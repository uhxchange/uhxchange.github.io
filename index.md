## About UHXchange

UHXchange is a web application that provides users to buy and sell items in the UH Manoa community. Users are able to search up items, purchase items, or exchange. Ultimately, it will allow two users to interact with each other and decide whether they want to exchange goods or purchase with currency. The Shop page will have a list of products the students have uploaded with a field that indicate if the seller wants to only sell, only trade, or open to both. The choice is theirs.

This web application illustrates various technologies useful to ICS software engineering students, including:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

## Developer Guide

This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers wishing to use this code base as a basis for their own development tasks.

### Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, visit the [UHXchange application github page](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange), and click the "Use this template" button to create your own repository initialized with a copy of this application. Alternatively, you can download the sources as a zip file or make a fork of the repo.  However you do it, download a copy of the repo to your local computer.

Third, cd into the uhxchange/app directory and install libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If all goes well, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Application Design

UHXchange is based upon [meteor-application-template-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/) and [meteor-example-form-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-example-form-react/).

## Initialization

The [config](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/tree/master/config) directory is intended to hold settings files.  The repository contains one file: [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/blob/master/config/settings.development.json).

This file contains default definitions for Contacts and Products and the relationships between them.

The settings.development.json file contains a field called "loadAssetsFile". It is set to false, but if you change it to true, then the data in the file app/private/data.json will also be loaded.  The code to do this illustrates how to initialize a system when the initial data exceeds the size limitations for the settings file.

### Quality Assurance

#### ESLint

UHXchange includes a [.eslintrc](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/blob/master/app/.eslintrc) file to define the coding style adhered to in this application. You can invoke ESLint from the command line as follows:

```
meteor npm run lint
```

Here is sample output indicating that no ESLint errors were detected:

```
$ meteor npm run lint

> bowfolios@ lint /Users/philipjohnson/github/uhxchange/uhxchange/app
> eslint --quiet --ext .jsx --ext .js ./imports ./tests

$
```

ESLint should run without generating any errors.

It's significantly easier to do development with ESLint integrated directly into your IDE (such as IntelliJ).

## From mockup to production

UHXchange is meant to illustrate the use of Meteor for developing an initial proof-of-concept prototype.  For a production application, several additional security-related changes must be implemented:

* Use of email-based password specification for users, and/or use of an alternative authentication mechanism.
* Use of https so that passwords are sent in encrypted format.
* Removal of the insecure package, and the addition of Meteor Methods to replace client-side DB updates.


## Deployment History

[UHXchange](https://uhxmanoa.xyz/#/) is running on Digital Occean.

### Milestone 1: Mockup Development and Authentication

Milestone 1 started on April 8, 2021 and completed April 15, 2021. 

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create collections and a mockup of pages in the system.

Milestone 1 was managed using [UHXchange GitHub Project M1](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/projects/1)

### Milestone 2: Mockup Development

Milestone 2 started on April 16, 2021 and completed April 27, 2021. 

The goal of Milestone 2 was to improve the functionality and quality of our application.

Milestone 2 was managed using [UHXchange GitHub Project M2](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/projects/3)

### Milestone 3: Mockup Development

Milestone 3 started on April 28, 2021 and completed May 12, 2021.

The goal of Milestone 3 was to significantly improve the functionality from Milestone 2 and to implement testing before finalizing the project.

Milestone 3 was managed using [UHXchange GitHub Project M3](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/projects/4)
