## Overview

UHXchange is a web application that provides users to buy and sell goods in the UH Manoa community. Users are able to search up items, "purchase" items, or exchange. Ultimately, it'll allow two users to interact with each other and decide either they want to exchange goods or purchase with currency. We'll allow users the option to either message the "seller" directly and decide from their. On the product page, it will show the user, the product the user is putting up to sell or trade, and a field that indicate if the seller wants to only sell, only trade, or open to both. The choice is theirs.

This web application illustrates various technologies useful to ICS software engineering students, including:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

## Milestone 1: Mockup Development and Authentication

Milestone 1 started on April 8, 2021 and completed April 15, 2021. 

The goal of Milestone 1 is to combine all of the groups idea developed during our own mockup of this project and combine these pages to create an application that is uniform in looks and has the links to the other pages working. In order to meet this goal, the pages will be developed as a Meteor app and FlowRouter will be implemented in order to get the routing to the other pages to work.

Mockups for the following pages were implemented during M1:

Milestone 1 was implemented as [UHXchange Github Milestone 1](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/milestones)

Milestone 1 consisted of ten issues, and progress was managed via the [UHXchange GitHub Project M1](https://github.com/uhxchange/uhxchange/projects/1)

Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and merged into master when completed:
